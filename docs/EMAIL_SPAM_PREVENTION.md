# Email Spam Prevention Guide - UPDATED

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

**Problem Identified**: Emails were showing raw MIME boundaries and quoted-printable encoding artifacts, causing them to be flagged as spam and appear broken.

**Root Causes Fixed**:
1. **Complex Headers**: Too many custom headers were causing MIME parsing issues
2. **Emojis**: Unicode characters (📚, ⏰, ✅, 📧) were being encoded as quoted-printable
3. **SMTP Security**: Using insecure connections reduced email trust
4. **Template Complexity**: Overly complex HTML was causing encoding problems

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Removed all emojis from email templates
- ✅ Simplified email headers to minimal set
- ✅ Enabled secure SMTP connections (`SMTP_SECURE=true`)
- ✅ Cleaned up HTML templates
- ✅ Fixed MIME structure issues

Add this TXT record to your DNS:
```
TXT: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@campuslearn-api.run.place; ruf=mailto:dmarc@campuslearn-api.run.place; fo=1
```
